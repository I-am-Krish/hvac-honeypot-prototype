# HVAC Honeypot — Sprint Prototype (Step-1)

Short description:
A research prototype: single-room HVAC simulator + safety controller (SCC) + simple front-end and attacker script used to demonstrate cyber-deception and safety responses.

Status: Step-1 (planning) — repo skeleton and design doc.

Quick start (Step-1):
1. Read DESIGN_DOC.md and RISK_CHECKLIST.md
2. Implement simulator and SCC per docs (Step-2 will contain day-by-day tasks)

Containment:
This project must be run in an isolated VM or private network. See deploy/containment_notes.md.
